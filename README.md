It's a neural network.

For snake.

Duh.

Why are you still reading this?

I suppose you want to learn how to use it?

Fine.

## How to use it?

```
pip install names
git clone https://github.com/JonPizza/Snake-Neural-Network
cd Snake-Neural-Network
python snake_nn.py all
```

Then to train a new neural network:

```
python epic_nn.py
```

To only use the brains of MaryBoden and StevenHohlstein:

```
python snake_nn.py MaryBoden StevenHohlstein
```

To add new training sets to train on:

Remove closing ```]``` from sets.py

```
python make_sets.py
```

Play snake using arrow keys for an hour...

Ctrl-C

Add closing ```]``` to sets.py
